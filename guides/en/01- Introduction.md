# 01 – Introduction: Why Metadata Matters?

## A number without meaning  

Take the number:  

**82,000,000**  

On its own, this number doesn’t tell us anything.  
What does it represent? For which year? For which country?

## Turning data into information  

When we say:  

**“The population of Türkiye in 2025 is 82 million.”**  

Now the value has *metadata*:  
- **Indicator:** Population  
- **Reference area (REF_AREA):** Türkiye  
- **Time period (TIME_PERIOD):** 2025  
- **Value (OBS_VALUE):** 82,000,000  
- **Unit:** Persons

## Adding more detail  

Consider another statement:  

**“The female population of İstanbul in 2025 is 9 million.”**  

New detail is needed:  
- **Indicator:** Population  
- **Reference area (REF_AREA):** İstanbul  
- **Time period (TIME_PERIOD):** 2025  
- **Sex (SEX):** Female  
- **Value (OBS_VALUE):** 9,000,000  
- **Unit:** Persons

## Lesson learned  

- The same number can be described with **different levels of detail**.  
- The level of detail depends on the **purpose of the data use**.  
- Metadata gives the context that turns raw numbers into meaningful information.

## 🔑 Key point  

Without metadata, a number is just a number.  
With metadata, it becomes information that can be **understood, compared, and reused**.
